Honor / Huawei made another gorgeous look handset in 2019.
I received the same yesterday, so few points I can elaborate today, but I definitely revise my review soon after a month or two.
 Look is stunning
 Rear Camera is awesome though its hard to understand that what 3D TOF actually is. But 48Megapixels are more than enough, you can ZOOM how much you want but PPI (Pixel per inches) will never fetch
 Front Camera - Same as above, (Do not forget to OFF beauty plus button) front camera is also stunning.
 Turbo/Super charging. I charged it only 20 minutes yesterday and battery goes 5% t0 76%.
 Size is almost same as Honor 9i was. Though molded screen is better than that.
 NO heat till yet, though phone was hot when the delivery agent bring it to me but that because he took the box in sunlight before delivering (In his back pack and he was on two wheeler)
 Sound is good, not too awesome.
Overall phone is better than Iphone ;) . I will revise my review after a month for sure.
Thanks
