THIS IS SOMETHING I WAITED FOR YEARS , FINALLY I GOT THIS WITH A DECENT PRICE AROUND 55K.
I CANT WRITE HERE A LOT BECAUSE FEELING OF USING A MAC AND HIGH SIERRA OS IS AMAZING
BUILD QUALITY IS STRONG AND PREMIUM
ONLY LITTLE DISAPPOINTMENT IS SCREEN RESOLUTION GRAPHICS.
OVERALL A DECENT AND CLASSY PRODUCT
