I bought it for Rs.43990 and it's completely worth it.

Best display, best for VR. As a matter of fact Samsung is the one manufactures display for iPhones.

Battery is not that bad, PUBG 1hr, PENUP drawing 1hr, VRTV 20min and some more activities I got 4hr 50min screen on time and 6hr device idle.

Best camera in a phone for low light photography, I have attached photo of moon zoom to see it(tool it with pro mode), in some cases it can capture more than what our eyes can notice.
But with normal and artificial lighting colours are not that accurate.

I can't find a legitimate screen protector, so using this with a little fear.
