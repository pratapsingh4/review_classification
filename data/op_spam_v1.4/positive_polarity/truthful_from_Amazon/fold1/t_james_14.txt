I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all.
