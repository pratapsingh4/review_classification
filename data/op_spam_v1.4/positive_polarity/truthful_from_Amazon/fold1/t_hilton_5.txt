This is my first review. I was using one 5T and was very happy with the performance. When one plus 6 was launched I thought to upgrade , but then decided to wait for 6T.. which might cost around 44k. To be very honest I was never fan of Samsung, but when I saw Note 9 with one of my friend I was really amazed to see the built quality. Of course Note 9 is kind of almsot double the price of one plus. So i took look at Note 8. And it is almost similar. And then I started thinking about the features of any anroid phone which we see on you tube and stuff. 80% of which we never use. So I went for note 8. And it is the bes5 decision I made. The curve glass design. The camera quality. The weight. And the stylus. When you take it out 50% of the people around will ask you which model it is. And that too at 44k. Just go for it.

Only con: battery life. It lasts around 5/6 hours if used to full extent. But of course it has fast charging facility (charger and cable capable of fast charging is provided within box unlike I Phone)

Just go for it if you want to stand out in crowd.
