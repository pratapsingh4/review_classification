I purchased this for my mother, she is a prolific writer / poet and spends a ton of time on computers these days as a result. She has had fairly bad experiences with build quality, frequent hardware issues with other brands in the past and so wanted a good sturdy sleak laptop, this was a perfect fit for her, especially now that the price was reasonably low and discounted, it was a no-brainer.
