Reviewing after using 3 month.

Rear Camara is good but not satisfactory as per price band. Vivo v11 pro and one plus 6t captures better pictures.
Sound quality is outstanding, u won't disappointed.
You might little bit disappointed for battery backup if you are heavy user but for me, it is a full day perk.
Display is the reason for what the flagship of samsung rules the world. You love it.
While talking other hardware specs, all are best tuned and you always happy with that. No lags, no hang, no heating.

I suggest to buy it according to your need while considering above points. But all over , with price band and new specs, i suggest to have a look one plus 6t
