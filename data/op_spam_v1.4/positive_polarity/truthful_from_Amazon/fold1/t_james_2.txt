Processes things just like I need it to, stores things just like I need it to. A really good track pad with gestures and 4 finger touch. Screen isn't the greatest, but it's still good, it's just when you look at it from an angle that isn't dead on, you can't see much.
Battery can last me all day.
It's honestly everything I needed in a computer, at a great price.
