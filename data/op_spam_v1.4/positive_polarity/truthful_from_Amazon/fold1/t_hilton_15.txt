After 2 months of usage I'm writing this review, this is my first smartphone in samsung phones. I brought this for around 37k which is fully worth with no doubts. After a upgrade of one ui to Orea I feel phone is more smooth and bolt free. Display is awesome and impressing every moment when ever I'm using it. I'm a average user with no games for me battery life stays for 1 day. Phone premium and I will recommend this phone to go for it
