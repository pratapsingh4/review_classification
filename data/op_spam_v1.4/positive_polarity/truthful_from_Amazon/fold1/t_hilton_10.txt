Amazing product. Could have packed a larger battery. However, after the Note 7 fiasco, Samsung might have played safe. Display quality is superb, hardly a surprise. Love the S-pen, easy and convenient, specially for business notes on the go. Stylish and premium for sure. Super performance, no lag with Asphalt 8 or Pubg. Best in class for mutlitasking, no lag, no heat. Best phone for J-class people.
