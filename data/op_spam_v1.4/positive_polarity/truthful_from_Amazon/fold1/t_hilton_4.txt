After putting the note 8 to moderate to heavy use for long time, i am writting this review.
Delivery by amazon was quick-very next day of order.lets come to the point.
build and quality--(8.5/10)
typical samsung.metal glass combo..feels premium..its a big device so you will find one hand operations difficult.its not slim but no complaints...after all its - The Note.looks premium, solid built. comes with a clear back case in the box. a back case is must as the back of the mobile is fingerprint magnet.many complain abt its awkward positioning of fingerprint sensor,but you will get used to it in a day or two.
Display (9.5/10)
superb dispaly ..nothing more to say.
Camera (9/10)
Comes with great capabilities..its dual camera set up at rear..each of 12 MP. low light photos are good.OIS does its job while video recording.Front camera too is good.overall Camera is among the best devices available in the market

 S Pen (10/10)
Thats the reason we buy note...loaded with amazing features. simly superb!

 Hardware and Performance.(10/10)
fast , zippy and great at multitasking. the top end processor , 6GB RAM, and samsung UI does the job quite well.

Battery (6/10)
poor..hardly lasts a day.even at the moderate use most of the battery consuming features (like- always ON display, location etc) Off, the battery hardly lasts a day.

Overall (8.5/10)
considering huge cost of note 9...its still a better choice.i would carry a power bank with note 8 rather to buy note 9 .
