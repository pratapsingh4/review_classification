Ordered the phone during amazon sale period and my money turned worth. Excellent phone coming with the tech in hands, especially the S-pen is doing its wonder in parallel to bixby experience. The S pen is so convenient that I wrote a letter in my own hand writing on the e paper and submitted the document in e mode and it was so near to perfection. The camera is excellent and produces good quality images.
the worst part of this phone is its battery and it doesn't last long a day and the power bank that I had purchased for occasional travel charge has now married the phone and they are found together always, no choice as if one wants to save the battery optimizing the phone, then what was the point of purchasing a phone with full fledged resources in it.
Samsung needs to take care of the battery needs.
Product was timely delivered and it given to the discounts involved came at a very decent price.
