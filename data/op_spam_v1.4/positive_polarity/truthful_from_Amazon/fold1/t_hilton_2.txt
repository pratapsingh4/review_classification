Amazing build quality by samsung. At first I was confused with oneplus and samsung but as I do watch lot of videos and considering the superamoled display QHD+, ordered note 8 ( considering the price under 40k) spec vise it is not top notch phone but the charming display and the earphones we get with this phone is like heaven on earth. Battery is not so bad for regular usage. It lasts a whole day may require some topup for hardcore users. I would not say that is phone is fastest or snappy but no lags whatsoever. Camera is so good even if it doesn't have variable aperture, picture quality is just wooow. See the attached picture. Samsung has really maintained the quality here. Why go for a flagship killer when you can get a flagship!!. If you want a flagship for day to day use then this is it at best price. If you do more gaming then case is different because SD845 is better than SD835. If you get this under offers , don't waste time and go for it. Free tip: Also use spigen case for ultimate protection yet premium feel.
