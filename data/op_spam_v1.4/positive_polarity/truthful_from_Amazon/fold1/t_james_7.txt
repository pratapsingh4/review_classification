There is nothing to dislike about this machine. I'm sold by her looks, sleek and grace. It is not user friendly specially because i've had my hands on the black laptops forever but i'm getting around. I purchased Apple MacBook last year in December and it's been a pretty awesome experience. I love the MacOS applications. The keyboard is a delight to work in the dark. I have no issues with the sound quality! As a single user machine ,she never disappoints. Battery life is as mentioned. But to be very honest , I bought this machine because it adds to my collection of awesome gadgets. And I bought it because I could, I am so grateful! I love Apple products. They make for good show off, they look unique and stand out. This machine has been one of my best investments and technology acquired. So proud of her.
