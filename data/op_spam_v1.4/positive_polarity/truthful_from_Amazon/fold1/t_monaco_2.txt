I was a windows user for more than a decade and buying MAC was a big change. As I was using iPhone so thought to try Mac instead of PC. I bought during a deal on amazon and it costed me around 55k. I received laptop in great condition and it’s working great. I bought it for work purposes not for gaming so storage doesn’t bother me. Please go for it.
