I could grab this phone on Amazon Prime day on which special additional discount of Rs. 10000/- on exchange was given. Additionally I got HDFC credit card cashback of Rs. 4000/-.
Phone is excellent in all respect except battery life. I could run battery for one full day only when power saver was kept on continuously. Then display is changed from QHD + to HD+, always on display is not running etc.. So you've to compromise.
