I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much.
