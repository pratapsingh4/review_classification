Writing review after using it for 3 weeks
Charged it twice....And it would not charge 3rd time- but surprisingly the battery lasted 10 hours and I could finish my important presentation. 10/10
The customer care told that charging port had issue - and what a pleasant surprise they changed whole motherboard for free Excellent customer care 10/10
Touch pad had an issue but again it surprised me-- the immediate next day it came back.. wow
Their application at customer care is so good. Don't even have to stand in que.. booking appointments is so easy... And service centre was also very good. Had plenty of comfortable seats. Drinking water facility too. Customer care right in the heart of city and it was air conditioned.
Will update reviews about laptop once I get to use it...
A very Good company, Go for it... :)
