The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze. Many applications are supported, no issue in bluetooth or USB connectivity or WIFI connectivity.
