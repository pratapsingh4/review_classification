Disclaimer : Bought Honor View20 purely for the camera. (i cant comment much on the gaming performance)Read / watched quite a lot of reviews and made my decision over One Plus 6T.Rear Camera :Crisp and clear image and hardly no difference with 1+. 4K videos and full HD videos, background blur in the video, are cool features.Night mode is amazing., better than 1+48MP AI camera is just fine, its not Wow. You expect a lot more for that number. It matches ip with 1+Slow motion is only @ 720p.. 1+ is better off.Front cam pics are good, but videos are more stable in 1+ as V20 does not have image stabilization for front cam., hope there's a firmware update soon.Too many options available for photos and videos., You need to explore hands on to get the real feel of all the features.Personally i prefer the punch hole over the water drop notch. The screen looks bigger and the notch does not bother much.Needless to say about the design of V20, definitely gives a premium than the 1+Headphone jack, IR sensor, Notification lights are cool features to have (all 3 are missing in 1+)Lcd IPS display in V20 vs Amoled display in the 1+, which means though the battery might look bigger in number on the V20.,  1+ will last a few hours more.. The display in V20 is still good.User interface is better in the 1+ and honor's magic UI is way behind.The silicon back case is perfect.Overall not much of a difference between Honor V20 and 1+6T in terms of performance, display, battery or camera.Its good to hold a top notch, latest phone with first in class latest specs. Go for it. I'm happy with the phone.
