I would request customers who have brought items on EMI through SBI card pleasr check your statement details as I had brought this prouduct on EMI of 9666/- including interest but bank is charging additional interest on this. 9666 + 330. Actually if they had to charge then they should have charged either 9666 per month or 9444+interest for three month. I would request Amazon also to look into the matter so that customers can freely use SBI cards for EMI payment.
