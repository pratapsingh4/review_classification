Comes in a proper box, does not feels cheap (Rather feels a bit premium) . And ofcourse works fine . I've even tested it in water, sea water, I stayed inside sea water for 2 hours with this watch(at depth more than my height of 1.71meters at times) , and it's still working without any issues, so I can give it 6 out of 5 stars without any hesitation .
