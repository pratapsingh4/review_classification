I absolutely adore my new phone! The image quality is amazing. The portrait mode is a personal favorite. Its fast and the touch is amazing. The battery life however is not that great. Needs to be charged twice a day (24 Hrs) with normal usage - though the VOOC flash charge makes that less of a pain than it could have been.
The fullscreen thing is also good tho not all apps support it yet.
