Got the laptop in time. The packing was good but the laptop box seal was broken. It's really disappointing.
Other than that everything is ok and laptop is working fine.
Found some difficulty in installing windows but all's well that ends well.
Note: use command prompt to create bootable usb instead of Rufus or media creation tool.
