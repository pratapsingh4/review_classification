This is my 4th Xiaomi phone in last 3 yrs and this is the worst one I got. This phone is a mess. I am not sure why Xiaomi is not fixing the issues on this phone. I wasted my money on this. This has got horrible cons like:
 this phone will never show you notificaiton icon at status bar. So basically, you will get a sound or vibration that something app has got a notification but you cant see at the phone screen top status bar which is something a 3rd class phone also shows. So this means you will have either have to slide down the top of screen to check the hidden status bar or foolishly keep sliding and check which App has a notification. Worst experience.

 Screen is sluggish to navigate, slow one.
Sound out put is not that good.
Camera is average.
MIUI being 9.6 is very disaapointing and not user friendly. I was using redmi note 5 pro and it was far better. I bought this one just because of smaller size to easily fit into pocket. i am regretting now.
