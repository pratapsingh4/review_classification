Amazon send me the defective piece and I didn't get any help from Amazon customer service. When I told the problem what I am facing, they ignored and said that item is ok because we found no issue when check with smartcheck app. There are a lot of problems which can't be analyze by smartcheck app. The problem is with the speaker and mic. When I play music, sound is ok, but when I call to someone the sound is come back two to three times from speaker. It looks like that the sound is surrounding around us. It is very irritating to me and the other one too who is on call. My experience is very bad with Amazon customer care executive. I don't want refund, I just wanna replace the defective piece. They didn't help me to replace this defective item.
