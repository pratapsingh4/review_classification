Third grade experience with samsung. Ordered this 5 days back, received a damaged piece (manufacturing fault) replaced it, got another phone with display not working. I am shocked what the samsung company is up to, newly introduced M series so poorly built. Got 2 defective piece??? This is what happens when a company tries to build a cheaper phone to be in the competition.
