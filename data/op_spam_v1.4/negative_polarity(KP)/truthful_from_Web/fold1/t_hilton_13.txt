1.6 ghz processor, 3 GB RAM and 32 GB memo are not synced together and therefore the phone doesn't have speed. hangs every now and then. PUBG exp is worst it takes time to focus and shoot and by then ur game is over. face recognition AI doesnt works. interface is ok. charging takes more than 3 hours. so no fast charge as claimed by the company. all in all, good if you have expectation, bad if you are buying it for performance.
