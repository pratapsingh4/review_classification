There is nothing special about this phone except big screen.
1. Camera experience is worst ever compared to other phones in this range.
2. Poor body build.
3. You Tube videos shows blur, even you play HD videos .
4. Backup is not up to the mark. It takes almost 3.5 hrs to recharge.
5. I strongly recommend not to buy this Samsung M10 and even Amazon return policies are worst. So think read all T&C before going with this product.
