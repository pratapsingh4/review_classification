It's a worthless phone with only dislikes. The product is not up to the mark, the built quality, the resolution and the best part is the the camera is even worse. The dual camera is for name sake and you end up having pathetic pictures. It's best to have some different category phone for the same price brand rather than going for M10.
Also please note Amazon is not providing any service to return the product. They are just over promoting and overhyped the product to catch the customers in the net. Once it's sold as per them, they can't help.
Crux of the story from my side is don't go for it.
