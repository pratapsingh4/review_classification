 I buy this one few days before. A gift for my uncle. When we open it's for the first time. And i put charge for 4 hours . Then I turned on .it doesn't turn on and restart continues with Samsung logo startup. A service man comes and checked. It was software issues. I contact Amazon many times for a replacement no one doesn't contact me. I trusted Amazon and Samsung it was a huge disappointment for me.
