Zero stars.phone never successfully charged.returned after a torture from Amazon.1st request for technical support.technician came and found phone defective and issued power problem.then again request had to be made for pickup.pickup person came and demanded imei number.i gave him the phone which didn't start.he couldn't retrieve imei number neither from phone nor Bex as he was only a courier person who rudely declined the pickup and left.another pickup requested.this time again same story started by the pickup boy.can u imagine the nonsensical system where the pickup courier boy refuses to pickup the defective phone because it doesn't start.after a lot of hassles finally he was allowed by the officer in charge to take the worst phone ever Samsung Galaxy M10
