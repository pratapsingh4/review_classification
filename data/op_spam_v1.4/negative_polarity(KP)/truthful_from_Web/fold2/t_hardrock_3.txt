Don't buy this mobile
I'm using this from 3 months and its a horrible experience and I'll tell you why
1.display bad
2.sound quality is just okay
these 2 points are okay considering the price
but
3. Proximity sensor is there but won't work properly
4. While talking voice calls mobile goes into mute with out our notice
5. In pocket calls get answered all by itself
6. There is alot of lagging issues even when opening homescreen and app drawer
7. It takes forever to open other than regular apps
forget about installing new apps
3 to 7 points don't make any sense though we consider its price
You can only buy this mobile of you want only to use voice calls
