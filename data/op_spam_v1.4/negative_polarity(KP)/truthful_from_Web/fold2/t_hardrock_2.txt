I wouldn't rate even 1 Star as the Phone is Pathetic Soud Quality is so Poor not able to Hear and Screen Resolution is is So Bad we may get into Sight Defection and the Return Policy is Not to the Satisfactorylevel as AMAZON says Electronic can't be Returned Back but How is this Possible without seeing the Product we have Brought and on Dissatisfaction on the requirements how can we live with it I suggest not to Buy Electronic Items through Online if this is the Policy
