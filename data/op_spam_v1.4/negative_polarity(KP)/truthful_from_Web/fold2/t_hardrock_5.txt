I am sure many of us have fond memories of the NOKIA brand and the chocolate bar sized sturdy phones which refused to konk off even after roughest of handling. Frankly I never needed to visit a Service Center ever for mu Nokia 3315. No more true with HMD Global. I got this phone on 1st December and it started problems by 20th December - the SIM was not detected. I chatted with Nokia care & was instructed to try out a few reset steps which I tried but the problem remained. I visited the authorized Nokia Care Centre and they promised to update me on the problem and resolution time in 3 hours time, but they were not able to provide / not reachable for a week
