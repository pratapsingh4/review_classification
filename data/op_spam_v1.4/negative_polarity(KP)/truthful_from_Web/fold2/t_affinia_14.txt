Pics are ok types while any notifications comes the notification bar hides the screen and while dragging it up it doesn't work. Some times it hangs. The quick it gets charged with the same speed the battery drains. So not very happy one will have to charge it's batter atleast twice a day. Camera also take some times blur pics had to take it carefully.
