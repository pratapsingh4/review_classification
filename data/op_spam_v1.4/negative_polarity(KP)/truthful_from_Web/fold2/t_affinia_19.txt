Phone is not what it describes, expected with 6GB Memory. Games like candy crush and hay days get hanged and while u using any app and get a call there is no way u can receive the call, phone is hung. Worst is it gets heated up. Amazon is replacing phone after their technician inspected it and was able to replicate all problems. I only hope it is one off defective handset and not this model in particular
