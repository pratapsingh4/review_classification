Worst product. Delivered the faulty product to me. Both microphone and speaker are not working properly. Media is playing, but no sound is coming. Call quality is very poor in terma of speaker. Network Connectivity issue is another one problem even though I am staying in heart of the city and have very good network coverage on all other mobiles at my home. Totally, it was a very product delivered to me. And all this happened after around 10 days of getting the mobile phone. Now the replacement warranty is also over. Waste of money and worst service by Amazon.
