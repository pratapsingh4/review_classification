Amazon should not allow sale of such items in our site. The Nokia 1 I purchased stopped working within 14 days of purchase, I believe. It started overheating even when it was not connected to charger and was idling. Smoke smell came out when connected to charger.
We simply unpinned it from the charger and kept it aside for one day. the next day onwards, it is not even restarting.
VERY VERY POOR PRODUCT QUALITY
