This is a terrible phone, ever since we bought this we have made innumerable trips to the service center. I gifted this to my maid for Diwali and i am so embarrassed. There is no sound and one cannot hear the calls. Its almost like a 19th Century phone, nokia cannot get the basics right like a speaker/ basic part. NEVER BUY NOKIA again, i am not surprised that this company went down under. For the warranty period we will keep visiting the service center and then its end of the story. i am not getting any help from anyone its pillar to post running without any result.
