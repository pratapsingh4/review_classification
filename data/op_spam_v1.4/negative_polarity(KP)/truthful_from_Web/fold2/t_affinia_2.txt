Yesterday i received it but it seems package was repacked, Box was sealed packed, when box opened mobile phone was switched on settings were already Disturbed it was looking like someone used the mobile phone and repacked it back....
Phone is okay, not that impressive(especially the interface) and also no notification sensors
