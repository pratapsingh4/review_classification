I needed a phone, the price was good so thought it was worth a shot. It's only been a few days and I'm not sure if I will keep it. It has many good qualities but has some major problems that could make it unusable in the future. The first is the screen doesn't respond. Sometimes it takes several tries. Also battery life is short. I start my day at 7am and the battery is dead by 4pm. I'm not a heavy user and my 3 year old phone last longer even now. But I'll give it more time and see how it goes.
Update. It's only been a week and it has lockup twice once during a phone call, and went dark once and It was hard to restart. The thing that makes me sad is I really liked this phone. It maybe a defective one but not sure I'm going to take a chance a replacement.
