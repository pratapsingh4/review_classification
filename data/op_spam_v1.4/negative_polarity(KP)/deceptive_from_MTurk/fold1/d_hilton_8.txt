OnePlus you make great phones! I have bought and used every phone since OnePlus X !
But it's kinda stupid to remove the headphone jack !
And what did we get in return a slow fingerprint reader ?
No IP rated Water resistance ? No wireless charging?
Everyone's loves new features, but not at the cost of essential ones !
