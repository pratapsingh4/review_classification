Don't buy this product. It is not recognizing the second Sim. Its a different and a saperate slot for 2nd sim unlike the other phones and the phone is not recognizing the 2nd slot. It's better if both the SIM cards are placed in single slot. Battery backup is very low, you will need to charge twice daily.
