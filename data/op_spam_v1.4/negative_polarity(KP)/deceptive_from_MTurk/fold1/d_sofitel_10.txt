Android Oreo 8 itself required 2GB RAM and consuming entire RAM. no memory for applications. Videos play are not good. Not good for Amazon prime videos and hooq. Bloatware found difficult to remove. Not good for e-commerce and mobile banking. Internet browsing experience is unhappy. Poor performance because lack of memory. Just useful for basic phone calls. Only some small applications run without lagging. Worst and limited user interface. Very costly basic phone. Reliance Jio basic phone is far better than this one. This is my first highly unsatisfied purchase from Amazon. My recent 10 or G,even my old GIONEE M2 is better than this. I am not understanding how companies are releasing Oreo 8 phones with 2GB RAM. The hardware configuration may good but difficult to judge because of less RAM.
