Not at all meeting expectations, I still have my 5-year old Lenovo which performs better than this one... It keeps getting frozen at everything... has some major issues, especially for a brand new laptop, that too for a brand like HP & I haven't even installed anything big or major to slow it down soo much & it's only a few months old... I'm searching for my warranty information to return or get it replaced... I'm regretting choosing this over Lenovo bcuz I was getting a good deal, or so I thought...
