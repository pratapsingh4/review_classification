Had the phone literally a month worked perfect! Amazing I was online with it.... then all of a sudden the screen goes green with two boxes on it red and blue doesn't wanna turn on or off nothing! Honest to god nothing happen to it I woke up and it was just like that outta no where! So I send it in to get repaired and they say they can't fix it because of bullying liquid damage but it was on my bad under my pillow no way there could be liquid damage!! They say the warranty won't work for liquid damage! So basically I'm out my money I saved up to buy this phone wasn't worth it!! Smfh
