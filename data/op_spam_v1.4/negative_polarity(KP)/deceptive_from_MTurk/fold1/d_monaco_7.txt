I am giving this phone a one star because although I like the phone, this is my second one. Amazon send me a replacement phone but I'm still having the same problem and it's really rediculous. I don't have no mobile data on the phone. No, it's not my SIM card either. I've tried putting my SIM card in another phone in it works just fine. This phone makes you update the phone when you first get it. After doing so, all of a sudden the mobile data doesn't work anymore. Mind you I'm still paying for data. I'm so disappointed you have no idea. Has anyone else had this problem?
