Very disappointed!!
The manufacturer and Sellers need to check the items before dispatching!!
This product I have received is not even eligible to have a rating of SINGLE STAR. these are the issues I found with the product: Issue 1. The belt quality is not good. Issue 2. the second hand is touching to dial glass(there is a circle mark inside the glass) issue 3. the second hand is getting stuck between XII & I (at least for 10 sec) in each round, then it's obvious , it cant show the correct time, day & date. 100% lost!!
