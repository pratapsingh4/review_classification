5A is far better than this.
Full screen display is a bogus thing.
No remote control for AC, TV, SET TOP BOX etc.
Lags within the first 5 days.
Even hanged for a very short while!
3000 mAh battery backup but no quick charging!
Takes almost 3 hours to charge 20% to 100%.
Comes with a protective screen which one has to remove immediately as phone features are printed on it. What's the use of such printings after one has already bought it!? And what's the use of such protective screen!?
Don't like MIUI.
As usual no earphone.
As usual small cable.
As usual no gorilla glass.
As usual no waterproof coating or anything.
Overall experience is very bad. Already thinking about purchasing a new phone. The exchanged 2 years old Moto G4 play was far far better in every aspect.
