The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.
