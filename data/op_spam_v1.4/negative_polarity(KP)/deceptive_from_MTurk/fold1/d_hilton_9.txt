Phone is getting hanged and face unlock is not working. I received a phone on 8th November and logged a call with amazon on 9th november that my phone is getting hanged frequently and face unlock is not working properly. They have scheduled the technician visit on 11th November, however, technician not visited. I called amazon related technician, executive told me that technician not visited due to some personal reasons. They don't bother to inform customer if technician are not going to visit.
Worst experience faced ever.
Don't buy anything from Amazon.
