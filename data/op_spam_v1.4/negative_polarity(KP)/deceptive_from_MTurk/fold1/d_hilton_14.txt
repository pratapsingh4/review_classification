This laptop has 7th generation i3 processor with 4gb ram and 1tb HDD, still from the first usage only I found that this laptop is 20 times slower than my 5 year old Pentium Lenovo laptop.
Once you make the payment your payments also gets strucked with Amazon and also the policy is not at all customer friendly, they will not initiate refunds so that you can buy a new and different model if u want, you will have to settle down with the same model. I will be getting that same model again today, hope my 31000/- bucks does not go in drain as Amazon has confirmed that the 2nd product but same model will be working great. They said they will ensure this. I hope I don't have to go through the same pain and agony again.
