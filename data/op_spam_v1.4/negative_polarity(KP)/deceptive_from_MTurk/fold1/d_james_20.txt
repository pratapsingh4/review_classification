My phone was working great for the most part since I purchased it in March-- no complaints. However, the most recent patch was forcibly loaded onto my phone(there was no confirmation it just restarted one day with the patch). That's fine except that now the phone dialer no longer works. After speaking with multiple representatives that made me reformat my phone time and time again, the solution is still not resolved.
