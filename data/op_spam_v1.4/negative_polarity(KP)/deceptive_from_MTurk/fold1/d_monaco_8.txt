I bought this phone on May. I was very confortable with the choice because except for the camera wich is no good at all ( i was not excpecting something great for the price) , it was running fast and battery would last for a whole day and even to next morning.
Well, the battery suddenly started to perform really bad and it doesn't last for more than 10 hours with regular used.
As for the signal problemas i got to say it's true. I don't Know why but when i leave a place where i've been using wifi ,phone usually has some issues to get 4g data.
So, it's a good phone for the price but it has some issues that i find really unconfortable.
