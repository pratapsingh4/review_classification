The product is one of the worst functioning laptop. The product just hanging and i3 processors performance is pathetic and cant run basic functions. Clearly a specification created by HP to be sold thru amazon so that the buyers are stuck with the maze of Amazon support and question and answers. We are sitting on 2 laptops that have been nonfunctional for more than a month. We tried return policy and now been told this cannot happen with amazon for these products. so clearly a con job by both amazon and HP as joint party
