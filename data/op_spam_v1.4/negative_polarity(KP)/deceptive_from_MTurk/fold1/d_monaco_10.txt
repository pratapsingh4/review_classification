This is a beautifully designed and impressively priced phone that I would be more than satisfied with if one crucial aspect was present... It is NOT unlocked. I have spent the past two days trying to locate the source of my problem with my carrier to understand why my phone will not connect to my network. I originally assumed it was an issue with my SIM card, but it turns out my phone is still "locked" and will not be supported by another carrier until I contacted the company to resolve the issue. I reached out to them and did not receive any response. It has affected my work and I wasted $200 on a phone I had considerable hopes for.
