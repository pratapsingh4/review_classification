I am a big fan of redmi products. I have redmi2, redmi 2 prime and redmi note4.
So, I decided to by a phone for my Dad and purchased Redmi 6A thinking is its same or better than its ancestor .
But all my assumptions failed and here are my detailed analysis
1. Picture quality is not full HD and you don't enjoy if you already have full HD phone
2. Camera very very poor quality
3. Ram size is only 2GB and 16 GB thats bad for the price 5999 and that to long wait.
Note: I returned this phone and purchased Lenova K8 plus which is awesome with specs 3GB ram and 32 GB harddisk with depth enabled camera and stock android.
Redmi this time you failed me
