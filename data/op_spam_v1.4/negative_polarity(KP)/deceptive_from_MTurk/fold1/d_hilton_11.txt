I bought this laptop a month back during Amazon great indian festival. Been using it since then.
The product is light weight, Sound is good, battery backup is good. But the important of all , the performance is horrible.

I've exchanged my 5 year old HP laptop with 3rd gen i5 processor. This has a 7th gen i3 processor & still it's not even half good as my old one.

The system lags , ALWAYS.

Takes a lot of time to process any operations.

I made a fresh install of windows 10 by created a recovery media & it's a bit better than how it used to be.

I realized this is a faulty product but i was late by that time. the last date for return has already completed 2 days before that. So now i'm stuck with this super slow laptop, No where to go..

and the worst thing.. RAM has only 1 slot with 4Gb, can't upgrade.
