Bluetooth hell. It's a battle to get it to pair with anything. I had to fight to get it to pair with my truck and it won't pair with my car factory stereo.
Crap for Pandora, Spotify and I heart radio. While app plays from song to song the phone acts like it resets after each song. Starts the next song 8-10 seconds into the music, basically you miss the beginning of each song.
