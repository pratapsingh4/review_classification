They want you to agree to give up all of your information to their company and affiliates in order to use their phone any way they want to and can change the terms at anytime and do whatever they want to with your information. There isn't any other way to bypass it. If you value your privacy, don't get this phone. It is amazing how many people have no problem trading their info for a cheaper phone. I had no idea they were going to do that when I bought this, but I'm returning the phone.
