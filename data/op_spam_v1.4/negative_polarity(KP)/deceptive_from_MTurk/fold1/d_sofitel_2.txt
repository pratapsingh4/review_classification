So I was looking for a good exchange offer and got total 2.8k off and purchased it at Rs7k only. This was available at 8k (special discount) and its worth that price. I mean come on what else do you want? Good sound both from loud speaker and headphones,decent 16mpx selfie cam and 12+5mpx back cam and a SD625 processor at this price is outstanding. It plays PUBG really well, has good battery life with a proper dual sim+micro SD slot and a case, I am more than satisfied. Go for it if you are looking for a spare/additional phone.
