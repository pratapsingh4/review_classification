cell phone to a cell phone repair shop for diagnosis and repair and were told that they could not repair it because the motherboard had problems so we had to contact the manufacturer. After contacting Huawei Technical Support USA, we sent the device to Huawei repair center. Surprisingly they sent it back to me and mentioned that my cell phone had water damage, and that I cannot get it repaired since water damage void warranty. In fact, this was false as the cell phone was absolutely not in contact with any water, how can it been damaged by water? Furthermore, Huawei’s support team sent a falsified image of my phone with the incorrect IMEI number as proof of liquid damage which was not of my phone. I feel cheated by the company not just from its defective phone but also its deceptive support.
