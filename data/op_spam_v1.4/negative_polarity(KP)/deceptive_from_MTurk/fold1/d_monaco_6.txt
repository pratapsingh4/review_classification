Taking nasty ugly photos. If you are camera lover. Don't buy this. My friend have Huawei ascend xt2, it takes beautiful photos and videos. He bought as a deal of 40 dollars in Thanksgiving. After seeing his Huawei ascend xt2, I thought higher end of Huawei mate se will be pretty good for camera, also by seeing reviews in Amazon. Those who gave good reviews must be for the slim and sleek shiny look of the phone, but definitely not for the camera. Worst phone for camera I have ever seen and also screen brightness is not good. Huawei ascend xt2 is much much worth than this phone.
