I have bought more than 4 phones from @amazon till now and my experience has been good, unlike this time, I received a damaged product. The phone was sold by green mobiles. The phone was physically in a good condition but was damaged internally. The motherboard was functioning poorly so I had to take it to a service center where they updated the software but nothing happened. By that time my return period was over and I am still struggling with this device.
DO NOT BUY IT.
