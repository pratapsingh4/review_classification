Mobile worked great but Mi has trouble with screens. This is 4th encounter with Mi where the screen broke within 3 months of buying. Similar issues have been noticed by friends. I bought Mi5 this time, considering 1 year ACKO screen insurance plan was provided, but there is no appropriate from Acko's side for the mobile repair. It was a bad idea to buy this phone relying on screen insurance plan.
