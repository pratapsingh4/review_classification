Purchased this phone 6 months back..it fell from my hand accidentally at home itself and i was shocked to find the glass shattered completely inspite of rugged back cover and tempered glass protection..also the body of phone bent backwards..i have been using redmi y1 lite for more than a year now without any issues..there is some manufacturing defect in this model..though it is mentioned that it has corning gorilla glass protection i doubt it.
