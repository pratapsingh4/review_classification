The phone was ordered in Aug 2018 and in the end of the month, I experienced some issues with the display. The entire screen would be covered with a white band.
Now what happened to this phone is a mystery considering that it was placed in a Military grade armor cover from day 1.
I took it to the nearest service center to have it repaired. The service centres diagnosis was shocking, they said that alongwith the display panel, there was also an issue with some "shield panel", ridiculous considering the phone was in brand new physical condition. This was an inbuilt defect and was bound to happen. I wonder whether the piece was refurbished and. Anyways, always go for a reputed seller like Cloudtail for quality assurance. I hope I dont experience anymore trouble.
