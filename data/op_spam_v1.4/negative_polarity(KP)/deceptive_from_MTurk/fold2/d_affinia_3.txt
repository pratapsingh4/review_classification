its automatically rebooting and freezing 20 to 30 times daily. authorized service centre too worst because they know very well to answering "mobile is liquid damage, so it is out of warranty, you pay the money". they telling this answer 4 to 5 customer while i am waiting in service centre (approx 2 hours). That centres are not customer care. they care only money.
