The phone was working properly for hardly one week then suddenly its earphone sound stopped working. later on when it was taken to the authorised Service Centre they opened it first then later on said that your bill does not show the serial number so bring it again with the bill with serial number of the set on my invoice, for which I had to take up the issue with the Amazon which took another 15 days to get the invoice with mobile set serial number .when it was taken again to the service centre they refused to service the product under warranty by saying that it,'s motherboard is damaged due to liquid entry. The mobile set was being used very carefully and no liquid came in contact with the phone .Despite our repeated requests with the senior officials they refused to entertain and same and said that the motherboard is gone and it is not covered in warranty now. Just after use of hardly one week the product is of no use any further. Service centre is not entertaining for repair under warranty. Highly disappointed with the company attitude. I understand that many other customers have been denied Servicing under warranty on the pretext that damage has been caused due to liquid entry. I am highly disappointed with the company's attitude.
