Never take any xaomi's mobile they all are 3rd class phone.Once I was watching something in my phone(redmi 5) it suddenly
turned off I have taken it to the service centre,they opened the phone and told water gone inside and for repairing it will cost rs6000 whereas no water gone inside they told from sweat it can be.So think what a low quality mobile it is.i never face this kind of problem in my another phone like samsung .
