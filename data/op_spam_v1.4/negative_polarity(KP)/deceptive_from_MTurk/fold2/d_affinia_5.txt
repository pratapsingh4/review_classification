Please care before buying any MI phone. MIUI9 and MIUI 10 is heavyloded with ads, you will get ads everywhere. You open settings you will see ads, you open file manager you will see ad, you open security you will see ad, you open themes you will see ad, it's virtually everywhere and it's not limted to so called cheap phones, it's programmed in MIUI so its in every phone.
It's cheap but for a reason, MI is making huge money by selling ads and pushing these to our devices, i stopped using the phone will try to resell it.
Again it's your money, but be ready for spamming if you choose MI!
