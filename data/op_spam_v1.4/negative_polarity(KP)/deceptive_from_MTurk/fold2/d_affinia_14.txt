Bought it for my sister. It's aspect ratio is good. The phone looks attractive. But with time, the camera quality has been degraded. Phone slows down a bit with the software updates. But still its overall performance is satisfactory. I played PUBG without facing any lag in it. So the performance is fairly decent.
