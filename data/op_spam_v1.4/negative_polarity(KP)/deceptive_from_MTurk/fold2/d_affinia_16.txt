It's not worth purchasing. The phone hangs very frequently despite the fact that its internal memory has more than enough space, not more than 10 apps have been installed, not even being used for gaming, no time to see videos etc. Xiaomi has been deteriorating the quality of its products rapidly. I have decided not to buy Mi phone anymore.
