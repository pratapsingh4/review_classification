Bought a Redmi Note 3 on sep'2016. Used to update MIUI whenever there is an update. After the latest update to MIUI to 9.5.6 last week, the wifi detection function stopped working. The service centers had no clue. they reset my phone completely deleting my personal setup. That did not solve the problem. They came back and said that the phone needs a Mainboard Assy change and gave me a quotation for 4482.82. I stepped back and decided to look for another phone and that would certainly not an Xiaomi or Redmi.
Google search also will tell you that this issue is commonly reported by Redmi users. There is a problem record in the MIUI support portal with no definite solution
